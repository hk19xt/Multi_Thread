# Multi_Thread
This program is running multi-threads using deadlocks.

How to run this program: 
1) When you run the main class, you can choose the menu, including pasta, pizza, frozen pizza, and chicken.
2) You can choose the menu between 1 to 4. Enter the number of menus.
3) After choosing the menu, you can also enter the number of how many menus you want to order.
4) After entering the number of menu orders, then the program automatically runs by multi-threads with deadlocks.

Note: Deadlock will be implemented during the runtime because some recipes have to use same ingredients.
For example, while cooking pasta, the flour cannot be used to make a slice of pizza.

This program is one of individual school assignments using Java.
